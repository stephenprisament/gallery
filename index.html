							<h2>Bench by Duckpond</h2>
							<p>I found this bench near the Duckpond at VT and found a hidden gem in the quote on the name plate.</p>

							<a href="images/fulls/bridgefull.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/bridgethumb.jpg" alt="You need to provide an alternative description for each picture" /></a>
							<h2>Old Bridge</h2>
							<p>While taking a stroll around the Duck Pond, I stumbled upon this small bridge. I never knew this existed so I thought it fit the theme of new perspectives.</p>

							<a href="images/fulls/berriesfull.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/berriesthumb.jpg" alt="You need to provide an alternative description for each picture" /></a>
							<h2>Berries</h2>
							<p>So, I know that this image seems a bit weird compared to all of the other images. However, as I was walking around looking for inspiration I had noticed that these berry bushes were every where. Since they seemed to be everywhere, I decided to consider them a part of campus(Since they were literally everywhere) and grabbed a unique photo.</p>

							<a href="images/fulls/cenofull.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/cenothumb.jpg" alt="You need to provide an alternative description for each picture" /></a>
							<h2>Cenotaph</h2>
							<p>This is the Cenotaph at the Virginia Tech Pylons. I realized that most "professional" photos of VT include the pylons but never really focus on the Cenotaph. Also, I got a nice image of Burruss from a unique angle in the background.</p>

							<a href="images/fulls/clocktowerfull.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/clocktowerthumb.jpg" alt="You need to provide an alternative description for each picture" /></a>
							<h2>VT Inn Clock Tower</h2>
							<p>I always though the Clock Tower at the Inn of Virginia tech looked awesome, but when I saw it from the top of Perry Street Parking Garage, I couldn't resist taking this shot.</p>

						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/creekfull.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/creekthumb.jpg" alt="You need to provide an alternative description for each picture" /></a>
							<h2>Creek</h2>
							<p>This is the creek that leads from the Duckpond to right behind the VTCC Obstacle Course. I was looking for things that would give people a new look at campus and when I remembered seeing this creek months ago, I also remembered that most people don't know about it. So when I took a look, I was able to get this beautiful shot.</p>
